### Verification bot for registers with full name and email

To build run:
```stack build```

This build depends on `libtinfo-dev` for Ubuntu 20.04. 

The configuration is in ```config.dhall```, this needs to be copied and filled in from ```config.dhall.empty```.

Bot tokens can be found in the Discord Developer Portal after creating a bot.

ID numbers, or Snowflakes, can be found in the UI by right clicking on something after enabling developer mode in Appearance under the settings.
